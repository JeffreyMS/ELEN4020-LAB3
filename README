1. About the application
------------------------

The code makes use of Phoenix++ MapReduce to perform a number of algorithms.
A. The top k query
   Which finds the to k frequently occuring words
B. The inverted index
   Which finds the line numbers in which a given list of words
   are found

2. Note before build
--------------------

A. The list of words to perform the inverted index is found on the inverted_index
   dolder and can be modified to the user's desires under given_list.txt

B. The name of the text file for the given list cannot be modified

C. Sample text files for demonstration are in the data folder and the text files should
   use CRLF format

4. Building and runnig the application
--------------------------------------
cd to ELEN4020-LAB3

To build the application: run 'make' on the terminal

To run the program: for word count
                     time -p ./word_count/word_count data/(textfile)

                     for inverted index
                    time -p ./inverted_index/inverted_index data/(textfile)
