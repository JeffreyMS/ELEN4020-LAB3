im given a word i need to find the lines in which the word is found
-----------------------------------------------------------------
the map function -- maps a every word with a key == 1
                 -- because all the words are gonna be compared and the key increments to show the number of occurence
		// so for the number of lines i will only have to store the line and the key
		// but i dont need the number of occurence so i dont really need the key
		 -- for me the more realistic solution is to split the text in to chunks.... and find the word in those
		    chunks and push back
		 -- i can add the word to have a vector<line number> and everytime we get a word we add on that line for

Now i have found a way to find the line numbers but since the lines are in parallel, we can create a data type to
determine which point is the current line chuncked to. if its the 3rd chunk then their position is that + size 2 + size 1
